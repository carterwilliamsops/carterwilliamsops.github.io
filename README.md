> **"Muddy Boots & Clean Code."**

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It is designed to showcase my transition from Field Operations Engineer to Technical Product Manager, highlighting my work in Fleet Telematics, Hardware R&D, and Software Development.

## 🚀 About The Project

As a PM candidate with a background in heavy-duty EV repair and material science, I needed a portfolio that reflected two things:
1.  **Technical Competence:** Clean, modern code structure.
2.  **Product Thinking:** A user experience optimized for recruiters and hiring managers (scannable, responsive, and clear).

### Key Features
* **Single-File Architecture:** Lightweight and fast-loading with no build steps required.
* **Custom Design System:** Built on a customized `Slate` color palette to evoke a "Dark Mode" IDE/Engineering aesthetic.
* **Responsive UX:** Fully optimized for mobile and desktop viewing.
* **Case Study Integration:** dedicated sections for "Fleet Operations Optimization" (Software) and "Product Formulation Labs" (Hardware).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core:** Semantic HTML5
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN for rapid prototyping)
* **Icons:** FontAwesome 6
* **Typography:** Google Fonts (`Inter` for UI, `JetBrains Mono` for code/data)

## 📂 Portfolio Highlights

This site features two primary case studies:

1.  **Field Ops Command (Software):** A PWA designed to reduce Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) for field technicians by aggregating error codes and parts data.
2.  **EcoGlide (Hardware):** A Graphene-infused chain wax formulated to reduce wattage loss in drivetrains, validating a 50% reduction in COGS.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

Since this project uses a CDN for Tailwind, you can run it locally without Node.js or npm.

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-v1.git](https://github.com/carterwilliamsops/portfolio-v1.git)
    ```
2.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
